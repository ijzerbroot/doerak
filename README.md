# fhorak keyboard layout

A modification of Dvorak that is more comfortable for words like `ls, ps -efl, select from, create, insert, delete, update` (for me at least).
This layout increases my comfort for statements that I often do in a hurry. 
I dislike overloading my right pinky and using the bottom row. Regular Dvorak and Colemak lead to either one or the other of those issues for me.

Anecdotal input of oft-used SQL and Unix-statements that I use showed 68% home-row and 24% top-row usage (just 8% is bottom row). Hand-balance is 43% left and 57% right.
Regular Dvorak has less home-row usage in my sample text (62%) and overuses the right hand more. (39% left and 61% right).
Colemak does notably worse for me at 15% bottom row usage and a hand-balance of 54% left and 46% right. 

Tested using http://patorjk.com/keyboard-layout-analyzer

This layout comes likely at the expense of worse performance on regular text compared to regular Dvorak... Caveat emptor

# Modified Hands On keyboard layout (hereby christened WHaLeDB)

Seems to fit my personal preferences and most often typed words quite well, inspired by Alan Reiser's comfortable Hands On keyboard layout.
An important goal was to make SQL statements feel good to type for me on a standard staggered ANSI board while keeping QWERTY shortcuts. I am sure it is not awesome for extremely low SFB counts but I do not much care.

Feeding `https://kla.keyboard-design.com` with my oft-typed words showed excellent results FWIW.
The analyzer seems to like it better than MTGAP, colemak (DH) and Dvorak and so do I.
Sample text:

ls /var/lib/pgsql/data
select usename, count (usename) from pg_stat_activity where usename is not null group by 1 order by 2;
git pull
git push

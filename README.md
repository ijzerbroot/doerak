# fhorak keyboard layout

A modification of Dvorak that is more comfortable for words like `ls, ps -efl, select from, create, insert, delete, update` (for me at least).
This layout increases my comfort for statements that I often do in a hurry. 
I dislike overloading my right pinky and using the bottom row. Regular Dvorak and Colemak lead to either one or the other of those issues for me.

Anecdotal input of oft-used SQL and Unix-statements that I use indicated that this custom fhorak layout leads to somewhat better hand-balance, less pinky-use and increased home-row typing for me over regular Dvorak and does considerably better than Colemak.

| Layout      | Left hand | Right Hand | Right Pinky | Home row | Top Row | Bottom Row |
| ----------- | --------- | ---------- | ----------- | -------- | ------- | ---------- |
| Fhorak      | 43%       | 57%        | 17%         | 68%      | 24%     | 8%         |
| Dvorak      | 39%       | 61%        | 28%         | 63%      | 29%     | 8%         |
| Colemak     | 54%       | 46%        | 17%         | 64%      | 18%     | 18%        |

This layout comes likely at the expense of worse performance on regular text compared to regular Dvorak... Caveat emptor

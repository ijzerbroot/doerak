# Doerak keyboard layout

A modification of Dvorak that is more comfortable for words like `ls, ps -efl, select from, create, insert, delete, update` (for me at least).
This layout increases my comfort for statements that I often do in a hurry. 
I dislike overloading my right pinky and using the bottom row. Regular Dvorak and Colemak lead to either one or the other of those issues for me.
This layout is no doubt flawed in many ways but it's merely a local optimization for me personally.

Anecdotal input of oft-used SQL and Unix-statements that I use indicated that this custom doerak layout leads to somewhat better hand-balance, less pinky-use and increased home-row typing for me over regular Dvorak and does considerably better than Colemak.

Personalized text gave the following metrics:

| Layout      | Left hand | Right Hand | Right Pinky | Home row | Top Row | Bottom Row |
| ----------- | --------- | ---------- | ----------- | -------- | ------- | ---------- |
| Doerak      | 43%       | 57%        | 17%         | 68%      | 24%     | 8%         |
| Dvorak      | 39%       | 61%        | 28%         | 63%      | 29%     | 8%         |
| Colemak     | 54%       | 46%        | 17%         | 64%      | 18%     | 18%        |

This layout comes likely at the expense of worse performance on regular text compared to regular Dvorak (`the, highlight`).... Caveat emptor

# fhorak keyboard layout

A modification of Dvorak that is more comfortable for words like `ls`, `ps -efl`, `select from`, `create, delete, update` (for me at least).
Increases comfort for statements that are often done in a hurry. Likely at the expense of worse performance on regular text... Caveat emptor

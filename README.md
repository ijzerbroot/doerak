# Doerak keyboard layout

A modification of Dvorak that is more comfortable for words like `ls, ps -efl, select from, create, insert, delete, update` (for me at least).
This layout increases my comfort for statements that I often do in a hurry. 
I dislike overloading my right pinky and using the bottom row and number row (for -, _ and =). Regular Dvorak and Colemak lead to either one or the other of those issues for me.
This layout is no doubt flawed in many ways but it's merely a local optimization for me personally.

This layout comes likely at the expense of worse performance on regular text compared to regular Dvorak (`the, highlight`).... Caveat emptor
